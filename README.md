These are the accompanying files for the the DevOps course I've created.

There should always be a 85% OFF coupon over at [sre.rs](https://sre.rs),
but you should also check if Udemy is offering a better discount at that moment.

All details are available on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/real-world-devops-project-from-start-to-finish/?referralCode=9AC467077593D22878A2) page, and I encourage you to watch the
"free preview" videos before purchasing the course.

Happy learning!
